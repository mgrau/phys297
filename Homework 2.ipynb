    "You can use these buttons below to launch this Jupyter notebook in either binder or Colab. Play around with each service, they have their own advantages. Colab will startup faster, but you may have to install your own dependencies using the `!pip` command. You will also need to be signed in with a google account. Binder doesn't require any account to use, but it does take sometimes several minutes to startup.\n",

Find the index of the element that is the string `'1'` and replace it with the number `1`. Also it looks like two of the elements got stuck together and added as the number `10`. Find the index of this element, delete it, and append two new elements, a `1` and a `0`."
