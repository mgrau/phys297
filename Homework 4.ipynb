    "There are many interesting and useful python packages that have been written and are maintained by experts, and you can make the most of your time by reusing their code. Most packages are hosted on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/). You can install these packages using the `pip install` command in your terminal. You can also invoke it directly from your Jupyter notebook by running `!pip install` once in a code cell.\n",

    "2. Install the `tqdm` package. You can use this to add progress bars to a loop that takes a particularly long time to finish. For example, below I have written a `for` loop that contains a `sleep` command that simply pauses Python for 100 ms to simulate a difficult calculation. Import the function `tqdm` from the module `tqdm` and use it to wrap the `range()` function (e.g., `tqdm.tqdm(range(100))`).\n",
    "3. Look on PyPI for a Python package that you think will be useful to you in the future (for research, or classes, or a personal project) and write the name and description of it."
